      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On all routes, the area behind the animated graph shows the app background color (white) rather than black.",
        "The canvas element has no CSS background color applied (computed background is transparent).",
        "The render loop does not paint an opaque background (no black or other solid fill per frame); only the graph edges/nodes are drawn.",
        "No visual ‘black flash’ appears on initial load or on resize before the first animation frame completes."

          "description": "Update the canvas element and drawing lifecycle to guarantee transparency: explicitly enforce a transparent canvas background (e.g., Tailwind bg-transparent and/or inline backgroundColor: 'transparent'); ensure the canvas is cleared to transparent immediately after mount and on every resize (clearRect right after resizing) to avoid any initial/resize flash; confirm the render loop does not perform any opaque background fill (remove/avoid any fillRect covering the full canvas if present now or introduced later)."
