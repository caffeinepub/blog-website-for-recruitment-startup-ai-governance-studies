  "summary": "The diff shows partial work toward transparency (clearing the canvas to transparent on resize), but the provided changes are truncated and do not clearly demonstrate that the render loop avoids painting an opaque background each frame or that the canvas has no CSS background applied. Additionally, unrelated project metadata/summaries were modified without being requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the animated background canvas so it renders with a fully transparent background (no black fill), allowing the app’s white background to show through while keeping only the neon nodes/lines visible.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet only shows `ctx.clearRect(...)` on resize; it does not (in the visible portion) show removal/avoidance of any per-frame background fill (e.g., `fillRect` with black) in the animation loop, nor any explicit removal/override of CSS background on the `<canvas>` element. Because the file is truncated, there is insufficient evidence that the full requirement and acceptance criteria are met (no opaque paint per frame; computed canvas background is transparent; no black flash on initial load/resize).",
