  "summary": "REQ-55 appears implemented by adding a new ArticleTemplate in `frontend/src/content/articleTemplates.ts` and wiring template loading into the Admin Article Editor. REQ-56 appears largely implemented by adding guest-access public article queries in `backend/main.mo` and updating the public pages/hooks to use them. However, the new template includes a Markdown image referencing an asset that is not shown as added in the diff, so the acceptance criterion about Markdown images rendering correctly cannot be confirmed from the provided changes. Several substantial unrelated changes (auth/profile/admin guard, homepage redesign, branding updates, etc.) were introduced without being requested.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-56",
      "requirement": "If the new article includes Markdown images, they render correctly using the existing Markdown image support (no broken layout).",
      "reason": "The new template content includes a Markdown image pointing at `/assets/generated/article-recruitment-india.dim_1600x900.png`, but the diff shows no added static asset files, so it is not verifiable that the referenced image exists and will render correctly.",
